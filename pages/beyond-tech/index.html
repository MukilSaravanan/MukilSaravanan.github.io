                <p class="beyond-tech-text">
                    Ever since my childhood, I have had a love for taking pictures. It all started with a young kid
                    (yeah, it’s me :)) with a low-resolution point-and-shoot camera, dreaming of shooting whatever he
                    found interesting. Over time, I tried out numerous techniques and compositions, and my passion for
                    photography grew stronger. During my bachelor univerity years, a friend of mine and I documented
                    historical temples and artefacts around my hometown. In May 2019, I purchased a Canon 77D, which
                    I have been using ever since. Gradually, I strengthen my knowledge of composition and learnt
                    different camera techniques. I, personally feel photography helps me develop a keen eye to notice
                    beauty in the world around me and sculpt every single component to portray the story.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here is a short story describing my thought process and experience while capturing the glorious
                    Milky Way.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Capturing the Milky Way had always been a dream of mine, but my first attempt in April 2020 was a comedy of errors. At 1:30 AM, I found myself debating with my mom for half an hour about where the galaxy actually was. When I finally pinpointed it between constellations, light pollution washed out the shot. Determined to learn, I started shooting time-lapses to better understand the night sky’s movement.

                    A month later, I tried a darker location, but clouds blocked the view. I didn't give up, though; I used the downtime to master techniques for shooting in light-polluted areas. That preparation finally paid off on a ride with my dad. We hit a pitch-dark patch of road, so I asked him to stop the bike, set up my tripod, and clicked the shutter. Boom! The first clear image appeared on my screen, leaving me absolutely stunned. It was a challenging journey of trial and error, which makes sharing these images even more rewarding
                    
                    <!-- Shooting the milky way in the night sky has always been a dream for me. The first time (01:30, April
                    18 2020), when I planned to shoot, I couldn't even see where it was. After many "there here" debates
                    with my mom for half an hour, I was finally convinced that the milky way was actually between the
                    two constellations. As there was some light pollution in my area, I couldn't capture it as I wished.
                    So, I started shooting timelapse so that, I understand its position better. I again tried shooting
                    after a couple of days but I couldn't get a satisfying image. In May, I tried shooting in a
                    different location away from lights. Yeah, the results were better than my previous attempts but the
                    clouds covered the milky way most of the time. In the meantime, I learnt new tricks to shoot the
                    milky way in light-polluted areas. Yeah, that was really helpful. Having some experience and enough
                    knowledge this time, I was able to locate it easily. I told my dad to stop the bike because the
                    environment was pretty dark there. I set up my tripod, clicked the shutter button and Boom! The
                    first picture stunned me. After that, I played with different positions and came up with those
                    images. Overall, capturing the Milky Way was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I'm really
                    proud and happy to share these pictures and the story behind them. -->

                                    These are the pictures that I shot at the end during that night. When I was composing these images, I found that the steps was a bit dark and lacking some interest. I had a thought, to bring some interest in that area. So, I turned on a flashlight and painted the foreground. If you are wondering about the red coloured foreground, it's actually quite simple. I covered it with my fingers (DIY, Huh?). Thus,it brings up the blue-red combo which is actually cool.

                                This was shot at zero point view in Aliyar dam during the golden hour. It was a beautiful sunny day in the late summer in Aliyar (around 20 km from Pollachi). While amazed by the beautiful scenery, people playing cricket caught my attention. After getting lost there, I took a deep breath, before composing the image.

                                What a magical experience it would be to play cricket with your pals while surrounded by stunning mountains. I really adore the part the most.

                            This was shot near Punjai Puliampatti. It wasn't the scenario, I usually go out to shoot. Though it was the golden hour, the sky was overcast and barely any light was hitting the scene. Realising the contrast in the scene, I switched my camera setting to monochrome and started looking for subjects. After some drive, I came across an old man looking after a herd of goats and i found him interesting to shoot. Idea from nowhere, I had a thought to go for some highkey shots. So,I quickly turned up the exposure to an extent, and boom! That's how I got this shot.

                                        This was shot near St.Mary's Church in Kothagiri. Yeah, It was foggy that time. I was trying to capture the vibe and suddenly I saw the man with an umbrella that created a bit of contrast with the background. So, I intentionally underexposed slightly to create that moody silhouette.

                                        This was shot in a concert hall at Coorg. Of course, it was before the pandemic. Loud music, strobe lights, smoke bombs, everybody was vibing, head banging, that was totally crazy. So, I wanted to capture the complete mood of the scene in a photo. After experimenting multiple ideas, I realized that slowing down the shutter was really helping me to capture the motion, I wanted. Figuring out the idea, I waited for something extraordinary to happen.

Music was slowly building up and I thought to myself, that was going to be the moment. Finally, the beat was dropped, smoke bombs were burst, lights were strobing at the same time. Fortunately, I was able to capture at 1" shutter speed and kept it abstract.

I, personally, like the motion blurred hands in the air (in the bottom left), showing the vibe of the people.

                                        It was an overcast evening near Punjai Puliampatti and barely any light was hitting the scene. As overcast weather creates deeper shadows and brighter highlights which brings in greater contrast, I switched to monochrome mode. It was interesting that the old man got off his bicycle and started pushing up the slope. I used the negative space and the divider lanes on the curve road to lead the eyes to the subject. If you notice keenly, you will understand that I have broken the rule of thirds which makes it kind of odd and unique.

I, personally, love the notion of how it guides the viewer to the subject, despite the old man being placed at the edge of the frame.

                                        This was shot in the streets of Kalasipalayam, Bangalore. The photography walk with Subham Farate started from Majestic Metro Station and down the avenues towards VisveswaraPuram (the paradise for street food lovers in Bangalore). The two young men were taking in the sight on a nice late evening. When the lads saw me taking pictures, they became excited.

                                        I love how it's composed to have tyres on both sides leading to the subjects on either side of the grids.

                                        This was shot at Senjerimalai after the first lockdown in India. After weeks and weeks of being inside the four walls, going out in the early morning to enjoy the nature, felt great as anything. As you might know from the past, I am being a fan of golden lights, I used the tree branches to frame the mount in the back.

                                        I personally love the beautifully backlighten tree branch, which also gives a sense of depth to the image.

                    <!-- I am the kind of person who listens to (and also speaks) music. Beatboxing is a unique musical art
                    form that uses the vocal tract to mimic percussion, sound effects and a lot more. I first fell in
                    love with beatboxing in high school, amazed by the variety of sounds that could be produced with the
                    human mouth. During college, I continued to perfect my skills and experiment with different
                    techniques and sounds. As I continued to practise beatboxing, it has gradually become an integral
                    part of how I express my feelings in new and exciting ways through music. -->

                    I guess you could say I speak music. I picked up beatboxing in high school, mostly because I thought it was great that you could mimic a drum kit with just your voice. I kept practicing through bachelor univerity days, learning new techniques and patterns along the way. I'm still learning, but it’s become my favorite creative outlet to let out some emotion and energy.

                <p>Here are a few clips of a Beatbox competition (2021) and a short interview.</p>

                    Through my journey, I strongly believe that working out helps me develop the mental fortitude more
                    than it does to my physical strength. It enormously callused my mind to be self-disciplined and push
                    my boundaries every day despite the hardships. I follow a workout routine of Push, Pull, Leg, Mobility and Endurance cyclically for 6 days, followed by a rest day on a week.

                    I’ve always wanted to cook and explore different cuisines around the world. So in September 2025, I decided to start a fun culinary challenge: cooking dishes from different countries every week. I divided the world into 12 regions and picked 7 countries from each one. Every night, I cooked one dish that I felt truly represented that country’s cuisine or somthing that I wanted to try out.

                    Throughout this journey, I discovered so many new ingredients and cooking techniques. It was fascinating to see how cuisines from different parts of the world can feel so similar yet so unique at the same time. Finding specific ingredients was sometimes tricky, but I actually enjoyed the process of searching local stores and occasionally traveling out of town just to get that one special item.

                    I originally planned to document everything in detail, like cooking time, taste, appearance, and difficulty level, but keeping up with that alongside daily cooking turned out to be tough. That said, I did manage to take photos of every dish. Over 13 weeks (12 regions plus one buffer week to catch up on missed dishes), I ended up cooking 84 dishes from 84 different countries.
                    <br><br>

                    I truly enjoyed the entire experience. Cooking something new every night was exciting, and sometimes my friends even helped with prep work. I also got dish recommendations from friends from different countries, which made the journey even more special. As always, I am very pleased to share the food with them and hear their feedback.

                    Overall, this was an amazing learning experience of understanding and appreciating different cultures through their food. I’ve added several of these dishes to my regular cooking rotation, and I’m genuinely proud of myself for completing this challenge. If I ever do this again, I’d love to focus more on documenting the process and learning even more about each country and its culture.

                    <!-- I always wanted to cook and experience different cuisines around the world. In the month of September 2025, I started a culinary journey of cooking different cuisines every week. Basically, I divided the world into different regions (I did 12 regions) and planned 7 countries from each region. Every night, I cooked one dish from each country that is a good representation of that country's cuisine and somthing that I felt unique to me. During this journey, I explored a lot and lot of new ingredients, techniques. It was fascinating to see how we share similarities and differnence across cusines. Buying specific ingredients for each dish was a challenge, but I enjoyed the process of hunting for them in local stores and sometimes go out of town just to get that one ingredient. I planned to document this journey in a very detailed manner, decribing time taken, taste, apearnace, difficulty level etc, but I couldn't keep up with the pace. However, I did take pictures of all the dishes I cooked. In a span of 13 weeks (12 regions + 1 buffer week, when I cooked certain dishes that I missed), I cooked 84 dishes from 84 different countries. I really enjoyed the whole journey. It is always a fun time cooking differnt dishes every night. Ocassioanlly, my friends helped me with certain prepartions steps. During this journey, I asked recommedations from my friends from their country. As always, I am very pleasured to share the food with them. Overall, it was a great learning and cooking experience; open-mindedly understanding, appreciating different cultures through their food. There are several dishes that I added to my daily cooking repertoire. I am actually happy and proud  of myself for completing this journey. When I plan to do another round of this journey, I will focus more on documenting the process and learn more about the country and culture.  -->
